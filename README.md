## Description

This project is a GitHub Action that builds a Docker-compatible image on
various platforms, tags the image, and then publishes a Docker image to various
registries. The action can be triggered by a push to a branch, a pull request,
a release, a schedule, or a manual trigger.

The images are tagged with SBOM attestations and OCI metadata.

The goal is to make it easy to build and publish images to various registries
without a lot of configuration.  When the project started, it was just to
build for DockerHub with an image name based on the user's DockerHub username
and the name of the repository.  The project then grew to support the GitHub
Container Registry (GHCR).  Labels and tags were added, followed by multiple
platforms (e.g., AMD64 and various ARM platforms that Single-Board Computers
(SBCs) like Raspberry Pis and such).

The project then grew to support more registries, including Quay, Harbor, ECR,
and custom registries.

The first use case was to build and publish images that could be used to run
containers that would run on a laptop, shortly followed by images that could
run on a Raspberry Pi.

### Features

#### Image Labels

The action will add OCI metadata to the image, including the following:

- title
- description
- url
- source
- version
- created
- revision
- license

#### Image Descriptions

The action will also update the description of the image on DockerHub, Quay,
and Harbor using the README.md file in the repository.

#### Image Attestations

The action will also generate Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) files in
SPDX format and use them to generate attestations for each image that
is built.

#### Composite Action Components

The action is a composite action that uses several other actions to build and
publish images. The action uses the following actions:

- [docker/build-push-action](https://github.com/docker/build-push-action)
- [docker/login-action](https://github.com/docker/login-action)
- [docker/setup-qemu-action](https://github.com/docker/setup-qemu-action)
- [docker/setup-buildx-action](https://github.com/docker/setup-buildx-action)
- [docker/metadata-action](https://github.com/docker/metadata-action)
- [docker/build-push-action](https://github.com/docker/build-push-action)
- [anchore/sbom-action](https://github.com/anchore/sbom-action)
- [actions/attest-sbom](https://github.com/actions/attest-sbom)
- [christian-korneck/update-container-description-action](https://github.com/christian-korneck/update-container-description-action)

#### Image Platforms

By default, the action builds images for the following platforms:

- linux/amd64
- linux/arm64
- linux/arm/v6
- linux/arm/v7

The action can be configured to build images for other platforms by setting the
`platforms` input.  The input should be a comma-separated list of platforms.

The `arm` images are built using QEMU emulation so that they can run on
ARM-based devices such as the Raspberry Pi.

#### Supported Registries

The action can be configured to publish images to the following registries:

- DockerHub (docker.io)
- GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)
- Quay (quay.io)
- Harbor (goharbor.io)
- Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
- custom registry

The action can be configured to publish images to other registries by setting
`_username` and `_token` inputs for the respective registries:

- **DockerHub**: `dockerhub_username` and `dockerhub_token`
- **GitHub Container Registry**: `ghcr_username` and `ghcr_token`
- **Quay**: `quay_username` and `quay_token`
- **Harbor**: `harbor_username` and `harbor_token`
- **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**: `ecr_access_key_id` and `ecr_secret_access_key`
- **Custom Registry**: `custom_registry_username` and `custom_registry_token`

#### Image Tags

The action adds various tags to the image, including the following:

- every build
  - `edge`
  - `{short sha}`: (short SHA hash of the commit)
  - `{long sha}` (long SHA hash of the commit)
- when the action is triggered by a push to a branch
  - `latest`
  - `{major}.{minor}.{patch}`
  - `{major}.{minor}`
  - `{major}`

## Usage

To use the action, add the following to your GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
  - name: Publish Image to Various Registries
    uses: wesdean/publish-image-to-various-registries@v1
    with:
      platforms: 'linux/amd64,linux/arm64,linux/arm/v6,linux/arm/v7'
      dockerfile: 'Dockerfile'
      context: '.'
      github_ref: ${{ github.ref }}
      repository_name: ${{ github.repository }}

      # to push to DockerHub, use:
      dockerhub_username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
      dockerhub_token: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}

      # to push to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR), use:
      ghcr_username: ${{ secrets.GHCR_USERNAME }}

      # to push to Quay, use:
      quay_username: ${{ secrets.QUAY_USERNAME }}
      quay_token: ${{ secrets.QUAY_TOKEN }}

      # to push to Harbor, use:
      harbor_username: ${{ secrets.HARBOR_USERNAME }}
      harbor_token: ${{ secrets.HARBOR_TOKEN }}

      # to push to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), use:
      ecr_access_key_id: ${{ secrets.ECR_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
      ecr_secret_access_key: ${{ secrets.ECR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
      ecr_region: 'us-east-1'

      # to push to a custom registry, use:
      custom_registry_username: ${{ secrets.CUSTOM_REGISTRY_USERNAME }}
      custom_registry_token: ${{ secrets.CUSTOM_REGISTRY_TOKEN }}
      custom_registry: 'registry.example.com'
```

All of the registry-specific inputs are optional.  That said, if none of the
registry inputs are set, the action will build the image and tag it, but it
will not publish the image.  It'll just eat your billing minutes.  I
recommend against that.

## Examples

### Build and Publish Image to DockerHub

This is a minimal example that builds an image and publishes it to DockerHub.

The action is triggered by a push to the `main` branch or a tag that starts with
`v` and a version number with a major release level greater than 0 (i.e., it
would run for `v1.0.0`, but not for `v0.1.0`).  The action can also be triggered
manually.

```yaml
---
name: Build an Awesome Image

# yamllint disable-line rule:truthy
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - "main"
    tags:
      - "v[1-9][0-9]*.*"
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions: read-all

jobs:
  publish_image:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4.2.2
        with:
          depth: 0
          tags: true
      - name: Build and Publish Image
        uses: wesley-dean/publish_container@v1
        with:
          # pass the basic data for the build
          github_ref: ${{ github.ref }}
          repository_name: ${{ github.repository }}

          # just push to DockerHub and nowhere else
          dockerhub_username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          dockerhub_token: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Build and Publish Image to DockerHub and GHCR

This example pushes to both DockerHub and GHCR.  The image is given different
names on each registry.

```yaml
---
name: Build an Awesome Image

# yamllint disable-line rule:truthy
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - "main"
    tags:
      - "v[1-9][0-9]*.*"
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions: read-all

jobs:
  publish_image:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4.2.2
        with:
          depth: 0
          tags: true
      - name: Build and Publish Image
        uses: wesley-dean/publish_container@v1
        with:

          # basic inputs
          github_ref: ${{ github.ref }}
          repository_name: ${{ github.repository }}

          # DockerHub inputs
          dockerhub_username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          dockerhub_token: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}
          dockerhub_image: "myname/awesomeimage"

          # GHCR inputs
          ghcr_username: ${{ secrets.GHCR_USERNAME }}
          ghcr_token: ${{ secrets.GHCR_TOKEN }}
          ghcr_image: "my-name/awesome-image"
```

## Questions

### Why do we need to provide the repo name?

Because the action is a composite action, it doesn't have access to the
`github.repository` context.  The action needs the repository name to build the
image name for the various registries.

### Why do we need to provide the ref?

The action needs the ref to determine the version of the image.  The ref is
used to determine the version of the image.  The ref is also used to determine
the tags for the image.  Like with the repository name, the action doesn't have
access to the `github.ref` data.

### What is the context variable?

The context variable is the path to the build context for the Docker build.
The default is the root of the repository (`.`).

### Why do we need to provide the Dockerfile?

The action needs to know the path to the Dockerfile to build the image.  The
default is `Dockerfile` in the root of the build context (so, `./Dockerfile`).

### Can we build images for other platforms?

Yes, the action can build images for other platforms.  The `platforms` input
is a comma-separated list of platforms.  The default is
`linux/amd64,linux/arm64,linux/arm/v6,linux/arm/v7`.

### Can we publish images to multiple registries?

Yes, images can be pushed to multiple registries.  The action can be configured
to push images to DockerHub, GHCR, Quay, Harbor, ECR, and custom registries.

### Can images on different registries have different names?

Yes, images on different registries can have different names.  The action
supports setting the image name for each registry.  For example, the image
name on DockerHub can be `myname/awesomeimage`, while the image name on GHCR
can be `my-name/awesome-image`.  This can be done by setting the
`dockerhub_image` and `ghcr_image` inputs, respectively.

### How are versions handled?

The action uses the `github_ref` to determine the version of the image.  If the
ref starts with `refs/tags/v[1-9]` (e.g., `v1.0.0`), the action considers this
run to be a "release" and sets the version to the tag.

### What secrets, credentials, tokens, etc. are stored after runs?

Nothing.  Nothing is stored.  The action uses the credentials to authenticate
to DockerHub, GHCR, etc. and when updating image descriptions on DockerHub,
Quay, and Harbor.  The credentials aren't used for anything else.  When they're
passed to the action as secrets, they're stored in the GitHub Actions
environment and are not persisted, even in the logs.  It is recommended that
credentials be stored in GitHub Secrets, not as plain text or repository
environment variables.

Want to be sure?  Check the code.  It's all there.  Here's a link:

[https://github.com/wesley-dean/publish_container/blob/main/action.yml](https://github.com/wesley-dean/publish_container/blob/main/action.yml)

#### Release tags

Images associated with releases are given the following tags:

- latest
- edge
- `{major}.{minor}.{patch}`
- `{major}.{minor}`
- `{major}`
- `{short sha}`
- `{long sha}`

So, if the tag is `v1.2.3`, the image will be tagged with the following:

- latest
- edge
- v1.2.3
- v1.2
- v1
- abc123
- abc123def456aaa7890123456789abcdef012345

(the SHA hashes are made up)

#### Non-release tags

Images that are not associated with a release are given the following tags:

- edge
- `{short sha}`
- `{long sha}`

### Image descriptions

For images on DockerHub, Quay, and Harbor, the action updates the description
of the image using the README.md file in the repository.

### What if I need to override the image's labels?  Customize build parameters?

Yeah, no, this action just handles the most basic stuff.  If you need to
customize the build, you'll need to use the underlying actions directly.  If
you want to provide a PR to include those variables, I'm open to it.
